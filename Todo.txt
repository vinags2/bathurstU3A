Quick items to remember

Edit Member Page:
General
- Make a Sticky Footer which is at the bottom of the page, unless there is more than one page of data,
    in which case the footer will be at the bottom of the text.
- make a scope for sessions not deleted or suspended
- make a scope for all models 'where not deleted' and make that the default search
- cut the number of database accesses in the individual member report, the class rolls report, and others
- in the url .../person/show/144 show the member details for member with id 144
- move the 'search' route to api.php, after working out how to authorize the api call
- trim spaces from names and other text entries before saving
- create a committee table to record who is on the committee, when, and in what position
Courses:
- add a cost field to cover extra costs for the course (either per class, or a one off) eg to pay for materials, or like D2F to use their facilities

Migrations
- add a virtual column any_phone to the people table with expression:
    if(`phone` = '' or `phone` is null,`mobile`,`phone`)
- delete duplicate rows in session_attendance_histories
- add a 'deleted_at' (TIMESTAMP, default NULL) to the venues table
- remove the menu items:
    - members details (PDF) (report_id = 51)
    - facilitators (12)
    - members? (15)
- delete all tables relating to reports and menus
- make the size of model_id and email varchar(100) in the tables
- create the levenshtein function (see the SQl in 'create DB statements' directory)
        (or maybe not -- depends on whether it is used in my search functions)
- check how soft deletes works. Do I have to update the 'deleted_at' column from the 'deleted' column before putting
        the application into production?
- make preferred_name in people nullable.
- change default value for 'committee_member' in people table to 0
- add a unique index for last_name, first_name on people and drop the people_last_name_index
- set config('myconfig.currentYear') to 2020 (or whatever the current year is)
- set created_at columns to now()
- add a payment_received (bool, default = false, not null) column in the membership histories table.
- fill all existing payment_received with true.
- add updated_by to membership_histories
- add paid column (0 = not paid, 1 = cash, 2 = cheque, 3 = credit card, 4 = direct deposit, 5 = honourary)
- when hitting return at 'select member to edit (memberships/contact details)', then select the first option in the drop-down list
- test
